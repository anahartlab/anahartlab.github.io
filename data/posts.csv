"The Story Behind 'Owls of Ahvenkoski'","2025-07-10","The inspiration for this tapestry came from my journeys through the Karelia-Finnish forests and the magical waterfalls of Ahvenkoski. During that period, I often traveled to Finland and Karelia, drawn by their fairytale atmosphere. The original piece was called 'Owls of Ahvenkoski', and a vertical version was titled '2 Minutes to Midnight' â€“ a tribute to Iron Maiden. The owls appeared after our exhibitions at psytrance festivals like Kosmos Festival and Solar Systo, one of which was fully themed around owls. The memories and energy from those events gave birth to this psychedelic vision."
